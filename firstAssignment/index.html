    <h2>Let's talk about html!</h2>
    <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <i>CSS</i> and scripting languages such as <i>JavaScript</i>.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <h2>Let's talk about css!</h2>
    <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
